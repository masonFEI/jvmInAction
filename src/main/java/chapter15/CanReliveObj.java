    /**
     * Called by the garbage collector on an object when garbage collection
     * determines that there are no more references to the object.
     * A subclass overrides the {@code finalize} method to dispose of
     * system resources or to perform other cleanup.
     * <p>
     * The general contract of {@code finalize} is that it is invoked
     * if and when the Java&trade; virtual
     * machine has determined that there is no longer any
     * means by which this object can be accessed by any thread that has
     * not yet died, except as a result of an action taken by the
     * finalization of some other object or class which is ready to be
     * finalized. The {@code finalize} method may take any action, including
     * making this object available again to other threads; the usual purpose
     * of {@code finalize}, however, is to perform cleanup actions before
     * the object is irrevocably discarded. For example, the finalize method
     * for an object that represents an input/output connection might perform
     * explicit I/O transactions to break the connection before the object is
     * permanently discarded.
     * <p>
     * The {@code finalize} method of class {@code Object} performs no
     * special action; it simply returns normally. Subclasses of
     * {@code Object} may override this definition.
     * <p>
     * The Java programming language does not guarantee which thread will
     * invoke the {@code finalize} method for any given object. It is
     * guaranteed, however, that the thread that invokes finalize will not
     * be holding any user-visible synchronization locks when finalize is
     * invoked. If an uncaught exception is thrown by the finalize method,
     * the exception is ignored and finalization of that object terminates.
     * <p>
     * After the {@code finalize} method has been invoked for an object, no
     * further action is taken until the Java virtual machine has again
     * determined that there is no longer any means by which this object can
     * be accessed by any thread that has not yet died, including possible
     * actions by other objects or classes which are ready to be finalized,
     * at which point the object may be discarded.
     * <p>
     * The {@code finalize} method is never invoked more than once by a Java
     * virtual machine for any given object.
     * <p>
     * Any exception thrown by the {@code finalize} method causes
     * the finalization of this object to be halted, but is otherwise
     * ignored.
     *
     * @throws Throwable the {@code Exception} raised by this method
     * @jls 12.6 Finalization of Class Instances
     * @see WeakReference
     * @see PhantomReference
